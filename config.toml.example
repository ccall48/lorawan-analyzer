# LoRaWAN Analyzer Configuration

[mqtt]
# Connect directly to your ChirpStack installation's MQTT broker.
# This is the same broker that ChirpStack Gateway Bridge publishes to.
#
# Examples:
#   Local ChirpStack:    "tcp://localhost:1883"
#   Docker network:      "tcp://chirpstack-mosquitto:1883"  (use the container name)
#   Remote host:         "tcp://chirpstack.example.com:1883"
#
# If running the analyzer in Docker and ChirpStack is on the host:
#   Linux:               "tcp://host.docker.internal:1883" or "tcp://172.17.0.1:1883"
#   macOS/Windows:       "tcp://host.docker.internal:1883"
server = "tcp://172.17.0.1:1883"
username = ""
password = ""

# Message format: "protobuf" (default, ChirpStack v4) or "json" (ChirpStack v3 / JSON marshaler)
format = "protobuf"

# Custom operator mappings (optional, higher priority than built-in LoRa Alliance NetID database)
# Use these to label your own networks or operators not yet in the built-in database.
#
# [[operators]]
# prefix = "26000000/20"       # DevAddr prefix in hex / prefix length in bits
# name = "My Network"
# known_devices = true          # Mark as "my devices" for visibility filtering
# color = "#3b82f6"             # Custom color in the dashboard
#
# Multiple prefixes per operator:
# [[operators]]
# prefix = ["26011234/32", "26015678/32"]
# name = "My Other Network"

# Additional MQTT servers (optional)
# Use [[mqtt_servers]] to connect to multiple MQTT brokers simultaneously.
# Each entry is independent — packets from all brokers are merged into the same database.
#
# [[mqtt_servers]]
# server = "tcp://chirpstack2.example.com:1883"
# username = ""
# password = ""
# format = "protobuf"
#
# [[mqtt_servers]]
# server = "tcp://chirpstack3.example.com:1883"
# format = "json"

# Hide rules - hide traffic matching these prefixes from the dashboard (optional)
# [[hide_rules]]
# type = "dev_addr"
# prefix = "26000000/20"
# description = "Hide my own devices"
#
# [[hide_rules]]
# type = "join_eui"
# prefix = "70B3D57ED0000000/64"
# description = "Hide specific JoinEUI"
